# FavoriteMovies
A project about the best that Cinema has to offer (aka my favorite movies of all time!).  
This is a Flask-based application that uses SQLAlchemy, APIs and Bootstrap to build an awesome movie list.

## Adding a Movie
A great functionality of this application is the "Add Movie". It fetches the search query into an API and allows the user to select exactly the movie they want.
As soon as a movie is selected, the user inputs a rating and a comment. Then it is displayed on the homepage with the others, according to the highest ratings.
This was all made possible thanks to the awesome TMDB, also known as [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Editing a Movie
The same comment and review fields are available to the user if they want to change any of these.

## Deleting a Movie
If the user wants to delete a movie, it is easily possible through the simple press of a button on the back of a movie card.
